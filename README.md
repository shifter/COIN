# Notice from NEXT exchange
Our development team has made the choice to fork an earlier code from COINvest. Github is an open-source website where developers are 'sharing' codes between other developers to make improvements of to implement it. For example, many applications today consist of parts of other software, such as PHP or Bootstrap, which is a popular framework. The code below consists of 4 smart contracts that settle a transaction on a blockchain. A smart contract is not an exchange, nor NEXT is using this code for her own purposes. Since we get the news that Coinvest was not happy that we 'fork' this public code on our Github we decided to remove the fork and upload our own smart contract for developers which want to generate a token (like COIN) to get listed on NEXT.
